Overall task - Provide Data mining and Machine learning (ML&DM) pipeline


Some tips:
1) Provide data analysis with data/features understanding. Data statistics. Feature types
2) Find out which features need to be transformed in some way: categorical -> one-hot(binary) vector, Text features -> number variables
3) Find out which features are correlated and try to combine it using Principal Component Analysis tool from sklearn
4) Setup and train KNearestNeighbors and LinearRegression 
5) Use crossvalidation to compare these two models
6) Dont forget about plots!
